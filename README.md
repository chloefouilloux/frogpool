Frogpool 2019/2020 Data Analysis

Hello! Welcome to the mega mess of frog pool data analysis!

Let me draw your attention to 2 R CODE FILES:

The first is "fp_19_graphs" --> This is Andrius/Jenni/Juan/Bibi data GRAPHS ONLY
All of the code there is ONLY for that data, as are the resulting graphs. 
I am working on a model code now, but for the moment, just take in the beautiful graphics.


The second R code file is "fp_timescales" --> in this code, I combine 2019 + 2020 data
and look at how pools persist on both yearly and monthly timescales.

This data is supplemented with the rain data from Parare provided by Andrius. 

Third (as of 8/9) is FP_MODELS_19 --> this are models for 2019 data. Still in progress, please edit and make better!
