Frogpool 2019/2020 Data Analysis

Hello! Welcome to the mega mess of frog pool data analysis!

First, let's talk data:

>>(1) frogpool19_v2_reduced is the mega data from 2019 phytotelmata sampling

>>(2) Pool_Data is the repeated sampling of ground pools during 2020

>>(3) PARARE_Meteo_Janv-Juin2020 is weather data kindly provided by the Nouragues Field Station in French Guiana during the time of our experiments.

Now, let's talk code!

>>**DataViz_EcoEvo** is are all of the data visulizations (minus the illustrations) in our paper. Enjoy!

>>**2020mod_EcoEvo** are our models for 2020 which focuses on D. tinctorious presence over time (resampled pools over the course of a month)


>>**PCA_EcoEvo** are our principle component regession and analysis. I would recommend first running the PCA (later part of the script)
>> to better understand what the regression is explaining.
